<p>Between 2001 and 2003 I was studying my A-Levels at Strodes college in Egham.</p>

<p>I loved music and I listened to all genres with a passion.</p>

<p>I had a brilliant Professor who helped me to love and enjoy Physics.</p>

<p>One open evening a 3d physics simulation that I had built was on display in the Physics classroom.</p>

<p>A few weeks later something happened.</p>

<p>I was visiting a friend for a party and on the way home, I was attacked at a train station.</p>

<p>I was kicked in the head mostly. The group who attacked were quite large in number.</p>

<p>This changed me forever.</p>

<p>Eventually I felt normal again but there was a lot of trauma.</p>

<p>A year later I was studying Physics at the University of London, Royal Holloway.</p>

<p>As I approached the end of my degree I started to feel a number of things.</p>

<p>I felt a deep loneliness in terms of spiritually.</p>

<p>I also had the idea for Quantum Sand, a free software app for learning that I wanted to build.</p>

<p>I wanted to help poor kids and adults who were denied an education.</p>

<p>As I felt more spiritual, I started to look into Abrahamic religions.</p>

<p>I realised that the truth of Islam made sense.</p>

<p>The same year that I accepted Islam, 2007, I went for Umrah.</p>

<p>I was sitting in front of the Kabah in Makkah and a desert bedouin told me: “Allah has chosen you for the garden”.</p>

<p>After accepting Islam, it took over two years before I discovered a Sufi tariqa.</p>

<p>I went to visit a group who are new Muslims.</p>

<p>The followers of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi,  leader of the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa.</p>

<p>I felt something in the Sufi gatherings or hadra.</p>

<p>I believe Sufism is a science within Islam and not a sect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I fell out with the followers of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi.</p>

<p>I think I was stubbornly refusing to follow the teachings exactly.</p>

<p>I regret sincerely having disputes or unnecessary arguments with the Murabitun movement of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi..</p>

<p>I want to sincerely apologise to the Sufi tariqa of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi.</p>

<p>I miss them as a community.</p>

<p>I left the Murabitun and went back to Shepperton.</p>

<p>I started a political satire blog called The Muslim Prince dot com.</p>

<p>It was mostly extreme satire. I grew up reading Private Eye.</p>

<p>I was very critical of some of the foreign policies of the UK.</p>

<p>I received a visit from the British Police regarding my blog.</p>

<p>I agreed to remove my political blog from the internet.</p>

<p>Then there was a period of suffering from anxiety and insomnia lasting a long time.</p>

<p>For many years I have had an unjust slander against me which many people believe.</p>

<p>In 2006 I had, as mentioned already, the idea for making a free and open educational platform. The idea went through various name changes but is now called: Quantum Sand.</p>

<p>As mentioned it led me to become spiritual and I started to look into various Abrahamic religions.</p>

<p>Islam made the most sense to me.</p>

<p>In February 2007 I accepted Islam.</p>

<p>Over this period I started to have anxiety problems, thankfully I no longer suffer from anxiety anymore.</p>

<p>In August 2013 I had been sectioned. I was suffering from anxiety and insomnia.</p>

<p>The lying doctors at the Abraham Cowley Unit wrote up a false report that I had agreed to having the symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I can state that I have never experienced those symptoms ever before.</p>

<p>The other psychiatrists all propagate the same lie apart from one private doctor who agreed with me that I do not have schizophrenia. She was unable to stand by me and get it revoked.</p>

<p>Therefore for many years I have had an unjust slander against me which most people believe.</p>

<p>In March 2024 I had been suffering with insomnia and was sectioned again.</p>

<p>At Melbury Lodge I had numerous slanders written onto my medical records.</p>

<p>First, bipolar and mania, which I have never experienced. 
Second, schizoaffective disorder, which I have never experienced.
Thirdly, back to schizophrenia, again which I have never experienced.</p>

<p>I am aware of a few of the lies being propagated by the Melbury Lodge doctors.</p>

<p>I was accused of visiting extremist websites at the same time that my laptop had been confiscated from me. So basically impossible.</p>

<p>I was accused of photographing other patients again, totally fabricated.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the forced medications made it feel like my body was becoming stronger the more pharma drugs I was forced to take.</p>

<p>I sincerely feel that my inner strength is only increasing on these forced medications.</p>

<p>I was next moved to Hollybank rehabilitation. After many months at Melbury Lodge.</p>

<p>I am increasingly thinking more and more about making Hijra to somewhere else. Hijra is where you move somewhere else for religious reasons.</p>

<p>I want to make Hijra so that I can leave this fictional schizophrenia slander behind me.</p>

<p>I am currently being forced to take 1300mg of Lithium for a disease that I do not have. I was being forced to take 40mg zuclopenthixol for a disease that I do not have. Now I am being forced to take 200mg of Clozapine for a disease that I do not have.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am strongly thinking of making Hijra. I have been looking at Saudi Arabia in particular.</p>

<p>I sincerely miss Makkah and Madinah.</p>

<p>Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi praised the Saudi Crown Prince, and I believe the changes in Saudi Arabia are exciting.</p>

<p>I would love to go back to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>If anyone has any ideas about me making Hijra and where to, then please do not hesitate to contact me via email, at andrewpottercv@gmail.com</p>

<p>I have my email in the description.</p>

<p>My hobbies include Chloe Ting Abs workouts, press ups to Jay-Z/Linkin Park. Running, listening to music, learning Arabic and learning about Islam.</p>
